## Binary Data Types & B64 Conversion Utils

{% hint style="warning" %}
TODO: We are still working on this. We'll update the documentation soon.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The API for these utils is still early-access and likely to change in the future.

When instantiating the `Othent` `class`, a polyfill for `globalThis.Buffer` is automatically added when needed. However,
when using this utils, that is not added automatically.
